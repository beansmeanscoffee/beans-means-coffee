The Boulangerie Bon Matin has been a place I’ve been meaning to visit for some time. I’ve walked passed it pretty much every day for some time now, and keep staring through its window drooling over the pretty cakes and pastries in its windows. 

Today, I gave it a go.

## The Venue

The venue is interestingly presented. Whilst parts of it scream warehouse-chic, with theatre-style lighting rigs and spotlights, other parts look very 1960s. (For reference, wicker chairs were never, and never will be, cool). Overall, it’s a nice environment and there is a surprising amount of space, given the deceptively narrow show front.

Importantly, it’s not too busy — or at least it wasn’t today — meaning I didn’t feel under any rush to get out so someone else could get in.

## The ordering process

Perhaps unusually for a coffee-shop cum bakery, I was invited to take a seat at a table, where my order would be taken. Upon reaching my destination, I realise that the *Bon Matin* also serve food, and that this is a vegetarian cafe. “*How very North London*”, I think to myself.

I’m served a few moments later, opting for a latte and a pastry. I was forced to opt for carrot cake in its place, as they were out of pastries, but no matter: I like carrot cake. Within minutes, I have my coffee, my cake and my happiness.

## The order

The latte I ordered was not the most beautifully presented I’ve ever had. The saucer it arrived on was chipped, and the milky pattern adorning its surface was haphazard. 

The coffee had a very faint flavour rose water. It was subtle and pleasant. It wouldn’t win awards for bold flavour, but it hit the spot.

The carrot cake I received was almost the exact opposite presentationally: baked into muffin-shaped spectacular, and topped with a healthy helping of butter cream and walnut. Taste-wise, this was a treat to the palette. As the fork approaches your mouth you get hit with a magical mix of aromas, and it is equally as delightful when it hits the tongue.

## Verdict

This is a pleasant little venue that’s worth a look if you’re in the Finsbury Park area. I wouldn’t go out of my way to travel across London for it, but certainly it’s one of the better places to go in the area if you want a nice cake, a nice coffee, and a nice place to sit.
