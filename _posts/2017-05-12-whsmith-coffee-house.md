I'm a seasoned vet when it comes to travel refreshments. I've had more disappointing *First Great Western Travelling “Chef”* bacon sandwiches than I care to count, and more over-priced station coffees than anyone should have to endure in a lifetime.

Captive market though, ain't it? It's a basic flaw of the human condition that we constantly crave nourishment of some description, and a strength (some might say abuse) of market economics that I can only buy coffee from very few vendors in a terminus.

And so we come to The Coffee House. Coffee House is apparently WHSmith's attempt at breaking into the retail coffee market. 

Normally the sight of a WHSmith in an airport would bring you vague and uncomfortable joy; a sense of familiarity only mega-chains can bring. But this? This is another instance of the market screwing you sideways as it sells you shit coffee at *”holy shit!”* prices because its in Stanstead airport. 

Let's dive to the detail.

## The Venue

It's a WHSmith. Do I need to say more?

OK fine. There was a real coffee machine, and a steamer for the milk, and the walls were tiled like an early 1990s council flat kitchen. 

Imagine that. And then imagine it inside a WHSmith.

## The ordering process

Now I will preface this by saying it was barely 7am when we tried to buy this coffee, so I whilst the service could have been friendlier, I do not hold the staff accountable for their early morning grump.

The process was easy enough, and — bonus — there was no queue!

That's about all I can say about it. I was tired, give me a break.

## The order

Our order consisted of 2 caffe lattes. Well, I say *caffe* lattes. There was milk in it, so it at least met half that description.

The *caffe* part was distinctly ashen. Like I imagine the stone of Pompei would taste like if you ground it into a powder and decided to put it through a coffee machine. 

Bad does not cover it, but on the plus side, for an airport, even the large cup sizes we boldly (stupidly) opted for were reasonably priced at *just* £2.75. Who knew you could buy so much unhappiness for so little?

## Verdict

It was fortunate that our low-fare friendly airline, Jet2, did not permit us to take these half-finished coffees on to the flight (*hot beverage fascists, that they are*) for *”safety reasons”*. It saved us from having to finish what was deeply, deeply unpleasant coffee.

Don't be fooled by the loving embrace of WHSmith. Avoid this coffee like the plague[^1].

[^1]: the raspberry and white chocolate muffin I had was nice though. Buy that.
