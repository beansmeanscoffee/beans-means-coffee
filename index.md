Coffee. 

We drink a lot of it. 

And we're on a voyage of bean discovery: we want to try as many different types of coffee as we can.

So we've decided to start blogging about our bean-based experiences, and to share them with you.

We'll be writing about [the beans we try](/beans/) and the [shops we visit](/shops/). If you'd like us to try a coffee or a shop, then [get in touch](/about/).
