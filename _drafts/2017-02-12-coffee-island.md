## The venue

Good seating with a mezzanine floor.
Way too many chairs: 2 chairs per side and just too cramped to be comfortable.
Wobbly table.

## Ordering process

Healthy dose of pretence - with a good amount of authenticity.
Clearly very hipster.
Oodles of theatrics in both the venue and the coffee creation process.

## The order

Good chocolate cake.
Served on a napkin - which I hate.

Blueberry strawberry raspberry overtones to coffee.
Very silky texture.
