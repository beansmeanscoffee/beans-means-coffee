Hi there. We're David and John, and we drink a lot of coffee. 

So much so, we're on a voyage of bean discovery: we want to try as many different types of coffee as we can.

So we've decided to start blogging about our bean-based experiences, and to share them with you.

**We don't get paid to do this.** All the coffees purchased for this blog have been bought with money from our own pockets. If, at some point, we begin to acquire coffee through other means, we'll make it clear on the posts we write.

**Got a coffee you think we should try? Then get in touch. [Email](mailto:john.peart&#64;me.com) or [tweet](//twitter.com/johnpeart) us.**
